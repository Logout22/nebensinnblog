Welcome!
########

Welcome to my new blog, where I will be posting updates on technology
that cannot be expressed as source code diffs.

I will mostly talk about projects revolving around the retro computers
that I own, the bulk of which are electronic helper modules
connecting the old machines to the modern ones,
thereby making my life as an administrator a lot easier.
Occasionally, I will also present new technology that I acquired
and tell you why I got it and what I intend to do with it.

I hope that these articles will be useful as references for me
(e.g. in case something breaks and I need to redo it),
but also help others to build similar things while
ideally cutting short on the research and avoiding the mistakes that I made.

Enjoy! :)
